Dependencies are either managed by Pip, apt, or by git subtree
(https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/the-power-of-git-subtree/).

Pip:
parsimonious (for PyNotam)
timeutils (for PyNotam, not sure if this is actually required?)

Apt:
feedparser (to handle NOTAM feeds from ourairports.com)
geojson (to generate the output files)
shapely (to generate circles for coords)
pyproj (to convert between shapely and sane coord systems)

Subtree:
https://github.com/slavak/PyNotam
